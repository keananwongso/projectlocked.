# Lockedout 🔒

A social accountability app to help you lock in and stay focused. Start timed sessions, share proof, and build streaks with friends.

## What It Does

- **Start Focus Sessions**: Choose a duration (25/50/90 min), tag your activity (Study, Gym, Build, etc.)
- **Prove Your Work**: Capture before/after photos as proof
- **Social Feed**: See what your friends are working on
- **React & Engage**: Support friends with emoji reactions
- **Social Credit System**: Friends vote on whether you truly "locked in" - earn +1 for yes, -1 for no
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with friends and climb the global rankings
- **Track Streaks**: Build consistency with daily streak tracking

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo
